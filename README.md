## üöÄ Weekly Breakdown & Project Steps

Below is how I structured my project over the four weeks, combining my syllabus tasks and technical solutions documented in my milestones.

---

### Week 1 ‚Äì Security & Initial Setup

- Identified vulnerabilities in web systems for a small business use case
- Installed and configured:
  - CentOS 7
  - Rocky Linux 8
  - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Enabled SSH for remote management across virtual machines
- Applied initial system updates and security configurations:
  - SELinux configurations
  - Firewall management (ufw, firewalld)

**Courses supporting this week:**

- Learning Virtualization

---

### Week 2 ‚Äì Scripting & IT Audit Documentation

- Practiced scripting for:
  - Updating systems automatically
  - Installing essential tools like Nano, Git
- Created IT audit documentation, including:
  - Network topology diagrams
  - Detailed command references
  - Audit trails for server builds

**Learnings from:**

- Learning Cloud Computing: Core Concepts

---

### Week 3 ‚Äì System Builds & Web Deployment

#### Ghost Blog Deployment

- Installed Docker on CentOS
- Pulled the Ghost container:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name ghost -p 0000:0000 -e url=http://10.10.xxx.xx:0000 ghost
    ```

- Verified Ghost container:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

---

#### NginX Reverse Proxy

- Deployed NginX on Rocky Linux
- Configured NginX to act as a reverse proxy for Ghost:

    ```nginx
    location /blog {
        proxy_pass http://10.10.xxx.xx:xxxx;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_read_timeout 900;
    }
    ```

- Commands used:

    ```bash
    systemctl start nginx
    systemctl enable nginx
    systemctl reload nginx
    ```

## Week 4 ‚Äì WordPress Deployment & Security Hardening

### üõ†Ô∏è LAMP Stack Installation

**Installed Apache2:**

```bash
sudo apt install apache2
```

**Installed MySQL Server:**

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

**Installed PHP and required libraries:**

```bash
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```

---

### üåê WordPress Setup

**Created MySQL DB and user:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE add;
CREATE USER 'addusr'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'add';
GRANT ALL ON Wadd.* TO 'WpUsr'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

**Downloaded WordPress via Git:**

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress /var/www/html/
```

**Configured WordPress with wp-config.php details:**

- DB Name: `add`
- User: `add`
- Password: `add`

---

### üîí WordPress Security

**Hardened file permissions:**

```bash
sudo find /var/www/html/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/html/ -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \;
```

**Moved wp-config.php for security:**

```bash
sudo mv wp-config.php /var/www/
sudo chmod 400 /var/www/wp-config.php
```

**Installed Shield Security plugin in WordPress:**

- Enabled firewall protection
- Activated 2FA
- Configured brute force protection

**Created `.htaccess` rules to protect wp-includes:**

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^wp-admin/includes/ - [F,L]
    RewriteRule !^wp-includes/ - [S=3]
    RewriteRule ^wp-includes/[^/]+\.php$ - [F,L]
    RewriteRule ^wp-includes/js/tinymce/langs/.+\.php - [F,L]
    RewriteRule ^wp-includes/theme-compat/ - [F,L]
</IfModule>
```
